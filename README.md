# Data Science Theory (and Practice)

If you are like me, you have realized at one point that you want to become a data scientist. Then you have realized that a data scientist has to remember **a lot** of theory and be also good with coding. While the latter can be trained on the job, the theory will be forgotten if you are not lucky enough to apply it in your current project.  
So here are notes from my various courses as a way to quickly refresh the basics of each topic. The sources for the information are all publicly available free of charge.

Short summaries of various data science topics (work in progress):  
* Rules of probability
* Probability distribution functions
* Inference for point estimates
* Hypothesis testing using the Normal Model
* Inference for categorical data
* OLS: Ordinary Least Squares Regression
* Model selection for regression, regularization
* Classification models (logistic, naive bayes, LDA, bagging, random forest, boosting)
* SVM
* Bias-variance tradeoff
* Text mining
* Recommender systems
* R tools for web scraping and APIs
